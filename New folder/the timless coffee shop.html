    <h2>Welcome to The Timeless Coffee Shop</h2>
    <p>
      At The Timeless Coffee Shop, we believe that great coffee and great company never go out of style. We’re more than a coffee shop — we’re a neighborhood gathering place where people come to relax, connect, create, and simply enjoy life, one cup at a time.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to serve exceptional coffee in an environment that feels like home. We’re committed to quality, kindness, and creating moments of pause in a world that’s always rushing ahead.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      The Timeless Coffee Shop opened in 2018 with a dream to bring people together over thoughtfully prepared coffee. Founded by a small team of coffee lovers, artists, and community-builders, we started with a vintage espresso machine, a few tables, and a big heart.
    </p>
